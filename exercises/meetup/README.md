# Meetup

Calculate the date of meetups.

Typically meetups happen on the same day of the week.  In this exercise, you will take
a description of a meetup date, and return the actual meetup date.

Examples of general descriptions are:

- the first Monday of January 2017
- the third Tuesday of January 2017
- the Wednesteenth of January 2017
- the last Thursday of January 2017

Note that "Monteenth", "Tuesteenth", etc are all made up words. There
was a meetup whose members realized that there are exactly 7 numbered days in a month that
end in '-teenth'. Therefore, one is guaranteed that each day of the week
(Monday, Tuesday, ...) will have exactly one date that is named with '-teenth'
in every month.

Given examples of a meetup dates, each containing a month, day, year, and descriptor 
(first, second, teenth, etc), calculate the date of the actual meetup.
For example, if given "First Monday of January 2017", the correct meetup date is 2017/1/2
 

## Running tests

In order to run the tests, issue the following command from the exercise
directory:

For running the tests provided, `rebar3` is used as it is the official build and
dependency management tool for erlang now. Please refer to [the tracks installation
instructions](http://exercism.io/languages/erlang/installation) on how to do that.

In order to run the tests, you can issue the following command from the exercise
directory.

```bash
$ rebar3 eunit
```

### Test versioning

Each problem defines a macro `TEST_VERSION` in the test file and
verifies that the solution defines and exports a function `test_version`
returning that same value.

To make tests pass, add the following to your solution:

```erlang
-export([test_version/0]).

test_version() ->
  1.
```

The benefit of this is that reviewers can see against which test version
an iteration was written if, for example, a previously posted solution
does not solve the current problem or passes current tests.

## Questions?

For detailed information about the Erlang track, please refer to the
[help page](http://exercism.io/languages/erlang) on the Exercism site.
This covers the basic information on setting up the development
environment expected by the exercises.
